# Java Basics: Control Flow (Task 1)

This repository contains a collection of beginner‑friendly Java programs focused on **control flow**, including branching and looping constructs. Each program is self‑contained and demonstrates a specific logic-building exercise.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project includes simple yet foundational Java programs that cover:

- Printing number ranges  
- Determining number signs  
- Reversing numbers  
- Finding the smallest of three numbers  
- Calculating discounts  
- Printing numeric patterns  

These exercises form the basis for mastering Java control flow and problem‑solving fundamentals.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** — version 8 or later  
- A Java‑compatible editor (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse, etc.)

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Programs

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheComputationalCore/java-basics-control-flow-task1.git
cd java-basics-control-flow-task1/task1
```

2. **Compile any program**

```bash
javac FileName.java
```

3. **Run the program**

```bash
java FileName
```

Replace `FileName` with the program you want to execute.

## 📚 Program Descriptions

### 🔹 PrintNumRange.java  
Prints numbers from **10 to 50** using a loop.

### 🔹 CheckNumberSign.java  
Checks if a number is **positive** or **negative**.

### 🔹 ReverseNumber.java  
Reverses the digits of a number (e.g., 876 → 678).

### 🔹 FindSmallestOfThree.java  
Determines the **smallest** among three numbers.

### 🔹 DiscountCalculator.java  
Calculates discounted price based on purchase amount.

**Discount Rules:**  
- `< 500` — No discount  
- `500–1000` — 10% discount  
- `> 1000` — 20% discount  

### 🔹 NumberPatternGenerator.java  
Prints a numeric pattern using nested loops.

### 🔹 NumberPatternGeneratorAlt.java  
Alternate implementation of the same pattern.

## 🎯 Usage Notes

- Each program runs independently.  
- Inputs may be hardcoded or prompted in the console.  
- Review each file for specific behavior.
